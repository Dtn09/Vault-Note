# **Welcome to My Engineering Notes**

Hello and welcome to my public notebook. This site is a collection of my personal study notes for my Aerospace Engineering courses at the University of Cincinnati.
My goal is to organize what I'm learning in a clear and accessible way. Currently, you'll find notes for:

- [[Aerospace/Computing/Aerospace Computing\|Aerospace Computing]]
    
- Statics and Strength of Materials (in progress)
    
- Aerospace introduction to Systems (in progress)
    
These notes are a work in progress and reflect my own understanding of the material. They are meant to be a helpful supplement, not a replacement for attending class and doing your own work. Use ctrl + k for search function to find a specific topic. I hope you find this resource helpful!

Good Luck with your study!!
Tommy Dang
